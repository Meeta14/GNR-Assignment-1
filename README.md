# GNR-Assignment-1
In this assignment, we were required to implement four variants of multi-variate Regression.
The aim here is to predict the price of each house using these three attributes namely bedrooms, bathrooms, and sqft_living.
We approached the problem via 4 different regressions. 
a. Linear and non-linear Regression
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Polynomial Regression
b. Regularized Regression
    1. Ridge regression
    2. LASSO Regression
